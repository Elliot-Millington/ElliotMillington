Beginning from the leadership election of the Labour Party in *2016*, this project has developed to take a broader vision of the political geography of the UK. This involves the publishing of our own work on our website and Twitter accounts, as well as working with the data journalism teams of mainstream media outlets including the BBC, Financial Times, and New Statesman.
